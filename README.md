# ðŸŽµ spotify-data-exploration

## ðŸ“„ Description  
This project focuses on **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**, data visualization, and feature engineering on a Spotify songs dataset.  
No modeling was performed; instead, the goal was to explore, clean, and visualize the data to extract meaningful insights.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objectives  
- Examine basic statistics of the dataset  
- Understand relationships between different features  
- Create various visualizations for better interpretation  
- Add new columns to enrich the dataset

## ðŸ“‚ Dataset  
- Source: [Kaggle 30000 Spotify Songs Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/joebeachcapital/30000-spotify-songs)
- Content: Song attributes such as tempo, danceability, energy, popularity, etc.

- Python  
- Pandas  
- NumPy  
- Plotly

## ðŸ“Œ Outcomes  
By the end of the project:  
- The dataset structure and properties were well understood  
- Visualizations made the data more interpretable  
- New features enriched the dataset
